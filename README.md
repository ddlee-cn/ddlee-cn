## Li Jiacheng

Hi there, I am a Ph.D. candidate from Vision Information Discovery And Recovery (VIDAR) group at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Prof. Zhiwei Xiong. I have been dedicating myself to improve users' visual experience through highly efficient, accurate, and controllable algorithms.

Iâ€™m expected to obtain my Ph.D. degree at July 2024, and Iâ€™m pursuing a position related to artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC), computational photography, and computer vision. If you are interested, please contact me via jclee@mail.ustc.edu.cn.

Please learn more about my works on computational photography and visual content synthesis at my [Homepage](https://ddlee-cn.github.io/)].
